        <h3 class="titleMake">N95 Respirators</h3>
        <p class="descriptionMake">
          The N95 mask is a form of respiratory protective wear worn over the
          nose and mouth to help minimise the chance of inhaling airborne
          particles like viruses and other germs. It is a disposable mask made
          from synthetic polymer fibres produced in a highly specialised process
          called melt blowing. During this process, the inner layer of the N95
          mask is created which forms the filtration layer capable of filtering
          out at least 95% of airborne particles when worn correctly.
          <p class="descriptionMake">During outbreaks of respiratory illnesses and during periods of
          intense air pollution, wearing N95 masks has been shown to help reduce
          the inhalation of compromised air, filtering out nasty pathogens which
          lead to illness or which can aggravate existing respiratory problems.
          Maintaining clear and unhindered respiration is vitally important for
          remaining fit and healthy and people with pre-existing conditions or
          respiratory fragility can particularly benefit from wearing face masks
          while they are out in public and unable to control the breathing
          environments that they find themselves in.</p>

          N95 Respirators In Industrial And Health Care Settings
        </h3>
        <p class="descriptionMake">
          Most N95 respirators are manufactured for use in construction and
          other industrial type jobs that expose workers to dust and small
          particles. They are regulated by the National Personal Protective
          Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) in the National Institute for
          Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which is part of the Centers
          for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
          <p class="descriptionMake">
            However, some N95 respirators are intended for use in a health care
          setting. Specifically, single-use, disposable respiratory protective
          devices used and worn by health care personnel during procedures to
          protect both the patient and health care personnel from the transfer
          of microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate material. These
          surgical N95 respirators are class II devices regulated by the FDA,
          under 21 CFR 878.4040, and CDC NIOSH under 42 CFR Part 84.
